Upgrading ProjectPier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General Notice: We are not changing the built-in upgrade checker in ProjectPier for pre-release
versions of 0.8.  0.8.0-dev and 0.8.0-RC1 and 0.8.0 (the final release) will all be
considered 0.8 as far as the upgrade checking utility is concerned.  That means that if you
have installed a pre-release version -dev or -RC1, you will not receive upgrade notification 
within ProjectPier.

All versions of ProjectPier 0.8 are database compatible with each other and with activeCollab 0.7.1.

There is not an upgrade script for ProjectPier 0.8.  A set of instructions is provided below, but use
them at your own risk.  Make sure you have backed up all your data (files and database) so that you
can return to your previous version if necessary.  

When upgrading, do NOT run the installation scripts!

1) Backup your database

2) Backup your installation files (you will need your existing /config/config.php to complete this 
   installation).

3) Unzip the ProjectPier package to a new directory on your hard drive, then upload to your server, 
   overwriting the existing activeCollab or ProjectPier installation files.

5) Add the following lines to /config/config.php that you backed up in step 2 (NOT the one you just
   unzipped, the one you backed up from your existing installation!!)
   define('SHOW_MESSAGE_BODY', true); 
   define('SHOW_COMMENT_BODY', true); 
   define('SHOW_MILESTONE_BODY', true); 
   define('TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME', '93c65403ce6b695a583e9e4c8c5b25e687283ee8');

   SHOW_MESSAGE_BODY = Set this to true or false, it determines whether to include message text in new 
                       message notification emails.

   SHOW_COMMENT_BODY = Set this to true or false, it determines whether to include comment text in new 
                       comment notification emails.

   SHOW_MILESTONE_BODY = Set this to true or false, it determines whether to include milestone text in new
                         milestone notification emails.

   TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME = set this to any unique string of characters, the exact length is not important.  This
                       is required, but only used to differentiate between installations when there are
                       multiple installations on the same server.
   
   Change from: define('PRODUCT_VERSION', '0.7.1');
            to: define('PRODUCT_VERSION', '0.8.0');

6) Upload /config/config.php that you just edited to your server, overwriting the existing file.

7) You should be ready to go now.
